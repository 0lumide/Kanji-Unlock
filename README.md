# Kanji-Unlock
The Source code for my Android app Kanji Unlock
It's still in closed alpha right now, but if you want in you'll have to join this google plus [group](https://plus.google.com/communities/104613637533901871221) then get the app from [google play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/co.mide.kanjiunlock)
This is a simple app that forces you to practice japanese characters in order to unlock your phone, quite simple really, it also has a backup pin methos just in case stuff happens
