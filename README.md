# Kanji-Unlock
The Source code for my Android app Kanji Unlock
It's still in closed alpha right now, but if you want in you'll have to do the following

1. Join this google plus [group](https://plus.google.com/communities/104613637533901871221)
2. Get the app from [google play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/co.mide.kanjiunlock)

This is a simple app that forces you to practice japanese characters in order to unlock your phone, quite simple really. It also has a backup pin method just in case stuff happens
